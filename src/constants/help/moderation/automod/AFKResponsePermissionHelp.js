    <Box.Body padding>
      <p>
        The AFK response permission allows members that have that permission to be able to
        have AFK message responses on the server. For example, if you only wish to allow
        Moderators to be able to have AFK message responses when a user @mentions a
        moderator this is how you set it.

    </Box.Body>
