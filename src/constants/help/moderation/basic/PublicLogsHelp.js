        Public logs are logged actions that you enable to be shown to the public. It will
        not include information like which moderator is doing the action to prevent
        witchhunt but helps other players learn how not to behave and avoid punishments by
        reading the reasons of other punishments. It can also be useful to help players
        see that your server is growing by making Member Add publiclly logged.
