        This status will enable or disable the mod mail feature on your server. The mod
        mails allows you to create an amazing way to provide your users to get
        help/support from moderators/admins of the server. Normally, someone must @mention
        the entire moderator role and alert all moderators and some may be busy or some
        may be able to help but everyone is disturbed. The other option is to direct
        message or @mention one single moderator at a time until you get the response you
        need. None of these are ideal and that is where Mod Mails come in. It allows the
        users to send a mail to all mods and admins without pinging all of them and
        whichever person is available can easily respond when available providing the best
        support to the users.
