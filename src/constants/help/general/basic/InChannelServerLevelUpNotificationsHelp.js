      <p>
        The in channel server level up notification messages are sent when a user types a
        message in a channel and they leveled up in the server's G4M3R leaderboards. The
        level up message would be sent in this case to the channel where the message was
        sent and this setting can enable or disable those messages.
      </p>
    </Box.Body>
